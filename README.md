# FallenDupre

Install Instructions:

Download the zip file from here.  Unpack it and place everything excpet the "DistroMods" folder where ever you place custom scripts for your server.  There are 2 variations of the armor,  one is of non-set armor pieces which are blessed, there are what Dupre will wear when spawned.  The second set of armor is the new Armor set that will randomly drop pieces when Dupre is defeated.

In the "DistroMods" folder you will find 3 folders labeled ChampionSystem, Data, and Sets.  These correspond to folder in your ServUO installation.  Merge the files provided as part of the Fallen Virtues champion spawn with the corresponding files on your server, or replace the files in a stock ServUO installation with them. 

Restart your server.  The New Champion will cycle through the randomized Champion Spawns automatically or you can place a new alter at a location of your choosing and establish a dedicated Champion Spawn for this system.
